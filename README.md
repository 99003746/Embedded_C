In the project, we have replicated the BCM module using STM32F407VG microcontroller with 32-bit ARM-cortex-M4 FPU core. We have implemented and integrated 6 features:
	
- Seat Control Module
- Door Control Module
- Power Window
- AC Conditioning
- Headlight Control Module
- Wiper Control Module


The functioning of these modules is replicated using indicators connected to the board such as buzzer, RGB, Moisture sensor and LEDs of different colors.
